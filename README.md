# VeChain - Supply Me  Some Blockchain

## Overview and Origin

* VeChain

* Founded in June 2015, by Sunny Lu, current CEO, the former chief information officer (CIO) of Louis Vuitton China.

* Sunny Lu graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China in 2002 with a BA in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

* Sunny held jobs with Netstar, 3M, Bacardi, and for Louis Vuitton China in 2010.

* VeChain’s development roots can be traced to the acquaintance of Sunny and Vitalik Buterin (Founder of the Ethereum Blockchain), through the Founder of Fenbushi Capital, Shen Bo in late 2015. The discussion between the two led to Sunny’s realization of the practicality of smart contract technology. At the beginning of the venture, VeChain built its own permissioned blockchain based on the architecture of Ethereum. Later on, VeChain landed its first client from the luxury industry where Sunny used to work.

* Mr. Lu learned about blockchain technology in 2013 and in the same year, he co-founded a company called BitSE. This is the company that lead to the creation of the VeChain blockchain.  The Vechain Foundation is founded in Singapore and oversees the development, governance, and advancement of the VeChain ecosystem.

* While undisclosed from multiple sources, Vechain has recieved funding over 3 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on May 5, 2018 from a Corporate Round round. Vechain is funded by 5 investors. DNV GL and PwC are the most recent investors.

## Business Activities:

* VeChain’s vision and goal innovating in blockchain is to lower the barrier of entry for businesses and enabling established business with blockchain technology to create value and solve real world economic problems, according to their Whitepaper.

* VeChain started business engagement for blockchain use cases implementing the first blockchain solution of anti-counterfeiting and traceability for luxury products in early 2016.

* Prior to the creation of the public blockchain technology and even now, the cost of “trust” itself is very significant to all business stakeholders. The inherent lack of trust between parties discussed earlier meant that 3rd party trust providers are needed to facilitate transactions between multiple parties. This is where the multi-hundred billion dollar industry of C.T.I. (Certifications, Testing, Inspection) had been built to add lubrication to business communications and transactions.

* The industry is currently led by giants such as DNV GL, SGS, Intertek, NQA as well as consulting firms such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Deloitte.  These organizations sell their reputation and harbor an embodiment of trust in business.

* However, these firms known to partner with large financial and tech firms alike, face the same issues with data storage, data management; this is where VeChain has built its niche and reputation.

* Data written on the blockchain itself is immutable, making data quality a key concern for businesses looking to utilize public blockchain. Even so, these data points can not be trusted to ensure the truthfulness of data by itself, nor can it be a quality check of what is being submitted. This is what is known as the ‘Garbage in – Garbage out’ problem that skeptical critics against blockchain argue.

* VeChain has been extremely intelligent in how it addresses this age-old issue. By partnering up with key providers who are leaders of C.T.I. industries such as DNV-GL, PwC and others, companies are able to ensure the quality of theirs and their supplier’s internal processes, providing assurance for the quality of data entering the blockchain in the first instance. By guaranteeing the quality of data, enterprise clients can enable numerous new kinds of collaborative business models.

* In summary, VeChain solves the ‘Garbage in – Garbage out’ blockchain dilemma by bringing in global leaders in assurance to guarantee data quality. This is a win-win situation for both VeChain and assurance giants as the value of trust is now transparent and enhanced for all stakeholders.
* There are many existing technical problems with other public blockchain platforms: the difficulty of writing data onto the blockchain, slow, scalability, costliness and costless, difficulty upgrading, fluctuating usage costs, which require users to store & manage crypto assets as well as pay transaction fees just to use it.

* VeChain's Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism eliminates the threat of foul play by bad actors, scales the blockchain, and preserves the ability of the Vechain Foundation to upgrade the blockchain when needed.

* VeChain has a unique structure – there are 101 block producing nodes globally as part of its ‘Proof of Authority’ (PoA) consensus mechanism. This number strikes the perfect balance of decentralization, scalability and speed, perfectly addressing the blockchain trilemma. VeChainThor (VeChain’s public blockchain) has the agility to rapidly respond to any network issues, upgrade the protocol rapidly and facilitate the levels of throughput enterprise clientele demand to run at commercial scale. Software upgrades are carried out across all nodes uniformly, eliminating the risk of forks, as has happened with other leading networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. This simultaneously addresses a key concern of businesses who are cautious about basing operations on-chain when a network fracture may negatively impact their digital assets or data.

* VeChain’s block producers have to first undergo KYC by the Steering Committee, a group chaired by 7 individuals from global organizations such as DNV GL as well as senior VeChain figures. To further ensure decentralization of power, Steering Committee members are elected democratically by VeChain stakeholders.

* As a result, VeChain is uniquely able to provide assurance about the individuals handling corporate data whilst ensuring bad actors can be immediately ejected from the network if there is any suspicion of attempted foul play. The PoA mechanism itself selects block producers randomly, meaning influencing block production is all but impossible, even if somehow, a majority of block producers knew each other’s identities. Critically, the data broadcast to the network is processed in a decentralized manner and the blockchain itself remains public and open source, with anyone being able read, write and to deploy their own applications and projects without permission. This maintains the critical openness necessary to give the public blockchain its economic value.

* On other public blockchain networks, the price of transactions can fluctuate greatly. On Ethereum, this unpredictability is unpalatable for business users who demand forecastable costs for the weeks and months ahead. Scalability solutions proposed by other blockchain protocols are needlessly technical, complicated and a nightmare for businesses who require stability for their day-to-day processes.

* VeChain solved this issue through the introduction of its unique two-token system, composed of VET and VTHO. VET, the native token generates VTHO, and VTHO is used to pay for transactions on the network. When network activity grows and VTHO gets too expensive as a result of increasing market demand, the cost of a transaction in VTHO terms can be reduced, allowing the network to maintain a stable transaction cost in dollar terms. Having these levers built into the token model make VeChain the only network capable of proactively managing the cost to use its network.

* To take advantage of public blockchains, there are some unavoidable and problematic aspects to consider – managing tokens to interact with services and paying transaction fees are two of the most notable. For the average level of technical capability, managing wallets and using crypto is simply too difficult, too different and too much of a hurdle to be adopted on a wide-scale. With the invention of fee delegation, VeChain successfully removed one of the biggest hurdles of adoption, the need to directly manage crypto to pay to use the network.

* VeChain solved the issue of users having to perform the action of paying for transaction costs to use a public blockchain with the invention of fee delegation, by letting designated 3rd parties pay for the transaction fees on behalf of the users.

* Fee delegation simply means allowing a third party to pay the transaction fees instead of the user. While simple sounding, it is an ingenious and transformative solution to one of the biggest hurdles for blockchain adoption. With this technology, average citizens and businesses can use public blockchains without ever having to manage crypto assets or convert/spend them to broadcast a transaction. Instead, they can simply use a blockchain product, service or application as they would any other internet-based application.

* The functionality of fee delegation was enhanced even further recently with the addition of the ‘ToolChain Credit’ (TCC) – a non-crypto credit that can be acquired by businesses with fiat and spent to write data to the blockchain when using ToolChain, VeChain’s all-in-one blockchain toolkit. This new addition completely removes the need for companies to interact with crypto, enabling the widest possible user base for the network by providing a solution for companies in legally grey jurisdictions, like the US and China.

* Fee delegation and TCC open doors that simply do not exist on other networks. Most importantly, When TCC is spent, VTHO is burned, ensuring the token economics remain intact and ensuring even more value will be brought to the network in the coming years.
