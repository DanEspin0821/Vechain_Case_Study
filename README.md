# VeChain - Supply Me  Some Blockchain

## Overview and Origin

### What is VeChain

* VeChain simply put, is a blockchain platform, "[designed to enhance supply chain management and business processes. Its goal is to streamline these processes and information flow for complex supply chains through the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT).](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vechain.asp)", as stated within Investopedia.
* VeChain's whitepaper, notes the vision of the company as VeChain’s vision as, "lowering the barrier and enabling established business with blockchain technology to create value and solve real world economic problems."

* VeChain was founded June 2015 in China by Sunny Lu, current CEO and former chief information officer (CIO) of Louis Vuitton China and Jay Zhang, who previously had a role as a senior manager within Deloitte UK and PwC China.

* Sunny held jobs with [Netstar, 3M, Bacardi, and for Louis Vuitton China in 2010.](https://cryptoupclose.com/vechain-founder-sunny-lu/#:~:text=VeChain%20founder%20Sunny%20Lu%20is%20on%20a%20mission,listed%20as%20VET%20or%20VechainThor%20on%20crypto%20exchanges).

### Beginnings of VeChain
* VeChain’s development roots [can be traced](https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/special-feature-and-interview-with-vechain-ceo-sunny-lu-hosted-by-vechains-angel-investor-ee8a13e994b0) to the acquaintance of Sunny and Vitalik Buterin (Founder of the Ethereum Blockchain), through the Founder of Fenbushi Capital (one of VeChains early angel investors), Shen Bo in late 2015. The discussion between the two led to Sunny’s realization of the practicality of smart contract technology.

* Mr. Lu learned about blockchain technology in 2013 and in the same year, he [co-founded a company called BitSE](https://blockchain.capitalmarketsciooutlook.com/vendor/bitse-transforming-supply-chain-through-blockchain-cid-88-mid-17.html). BitSE created a subsidiary company, "VeChain", that lead to the creation of the VeChainThor blockchain. At the beginning of the venture, VeChain built its own permissioned blockchain based on the Ethereum network as a token. Later on, moving away from the Ethereum network, Vechain migrated to their own architecture and ecosystem.

[Many of these executives](https://medium.com/@blockchainpaper/fundamental-analysis-vechain-ven-8e148b290b79) come from Publicly Traded companies such as, HP, PwC, Barclays, Louis Vuitton, Deloitte, Shangri-La Hotels and 3M, highlighting the diverity coming to the table.

## Business Structure
 
### Governance
* The Vechain Foundation today oversees the development, governance, and advancement of the VeChain ecosystem, and the VeChain team is headquartered in Shanghai.

* The below illustration visualizes the structure of the [VeChain governence model](https://www.vechain.org/governance-charter/#bit_xbgep):![VeChainStructure](VeChain_Structure.PNG)
* The Steering Committee is the governing body of the VeChain Foundation. It is selected by Stakeholders with Voting Authority. The Steering Committee is responsible for critical strategies and selects functional committee chairs to oversee the operational units of the Foundation.

* To become an authorized Masternode on the VeChain blockchain there is Know-Your-Client (KYC) documentation that must be completed in order for stakeholders to run a node. [An Authority Masternode is a server connected to the network running the VeChainThor full node software](https://vechainofficial.medium.com/https-medium-com-vechainofficial-authority-masternodes-4c1233c6f18e) and keeps a full copy of the blockchain. Authority Masternodes are the only full nodes on the VeChainThor blockchain that are authorized to validate and produce blocks.

* When upgrades are needed a voting process is initiated to allow stakeholders a say in the changes being made. Votes are disbursed based on holding the underlying cryptocurrency, VeTHor, or VET, holdings and disclosure. VET holders without know-your customer (KYC) credentials and with 1 million tokens in their account are assigned 20% of all votes while VET holders with KYC and the same amount in their accounts are responsible for 30%.

* Stakeholders voting authority is comprised of three categories, which consists of nodes, such as [Authority Masternodes, Economic X Nodes and Economic Nodes](https://vechaininsider.com/guides/guide-to-vechain-nodes-and-node-rewards/). Each category has different voting authority. Voting authority, is largely determined by how much of the cryptocurrency VeChain, is staked, determines how many votes the node may make.

* The stakeholders can be individuals, corporations, government agencies, non-profit organizations and other institutions with a stake in the VeChain ecosystem, additionally Authority Masternode holders must go through Foundation’s identity verification and background check. Per the VeChain whitepaper, the stakeholder voting mechanism ensures the inclusiveness of all designated stakeholders in the VeChainThor Blockchain ecosystem.

* The system of master nodes centralizes voting rights in a decentralized system. Critiscm can be made This is a result of the fact that VeChain caters to business's that require a differentiated level of service, allowing business to monitor the item or physical inventory they sell as the item is en route to verify its condition and authenticity. 

* While undisclosed from multiple sources, Vechain has [recieved funding over 3 rounds](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vechain/investor_financials). Their latest funding was raised on May 5, 2018 from a Corporate Round round. Vechain is funded by 5 investors. DNV GL and PwC are the most recent investors.
* At the beginning, while VeChain was exploring the blockchain application scenarios and industry, partners were introduced to the executive team, in which [Fenbushi Capital, one of the first blockchain venture capital firms in Asia](https://www.fenbushicapital.vc/index_en.html), was one of the first partners looking into VeChain's offering, and ultimately becoming an angel investor. After that, [DNV and PwC also saw the potential in VeChain’s business model](https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/special-feature-and-interview-with-vechain-ceo-sunny-lu-hosted-by-vechains-angel-investor-ee8a13e994b0) and recognized Sunny and his team in the process of cooperation, and upgraded their involvement from partners to investors.

### Protocols

## What's a Protocol?
* A protocol [is a set of rules that governs the transfer of data between two or more electronic devices](https://medium.com/@genesishack/draft-what-are-blockchain-protocols-and-how-do-they-work-94815be5efa7).  Protocols on our devices are running behind the scenes for the everyday interneting that is now common place.  Protocols establish how information must be structured and how parties will send and recieve information.

* Some examples of familiar internet protocols are:
  *  TCP/IP
  *   HTTPS
  *   DNS

* The protocols above are the underlying code that allows all Internet applications to run. Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google, Netflix, banking websites, news websites commonly used in our everyday lives run on one of these internet protocols.

## Blockchain Protocols
* Like the internet, cryptocurrencies also [have their own protocols](https://blog.liquid.com/what-are-protocols-and-why-are-they-important).  Cryptocurrency protocols allow users to manage their data. They allow individuals, or businesses alike to create an account, or a wallet, on a protocol that can then be used to pay for services and make transact on other websites.

## VeChains Protocol - Proof of Authority (PoA) & Multi Party Payment (MPP)
* [The VeChainThor blockchain uses Proof of Authority as a consensus protocol](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vechain.asp). There are 101 master nodes responsible for reaching consensus on transactions in VeChain’s blockchain. This differs from Bitcoin, which requires all nodes to vote on a transaction before reaching consensus.  

* Anonymous nodes are not allowed within the VeChainThor blockchain, and disclosure of identity are an essential pre-requisite to becoming an authorized master node. According to VeChain’s [white paper](https://www.vechain.org/whitepaper/#header), this uses less power and does not require a minimum number of validators to reach consensus. 

* Essentially, the Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) protocol is method that gives a small and designated number of blockchain actors the power to validate transactions or interactions with the network and to update its more or less distributed registry.

* The MPP protocol, [is a global patent pending payment model within the underlying base protocol of the VeChainThor Blockchain](https://vechainofficial.medium.com/introducing-the-vechain-multi-party-payment-protocol-525daf1bee7), based on the VeChain Foundations defintion of its protocol, "it is a tool allowing parties other than the sender involved in an on chain transaction to opt to pay for the network fees of this transaction to the blockchain."

* MPP is designed, such that everyday users will use the VeChainThor Blockchain with or without the knowledge of it. MPP enables seemingly no change to the end user experience and is what we strive for after our research with enterprise leaders.

## Business Activities:

* VeChain started business engagement for blockchain use cases implementing the first blockchain solution of anti-counterfeiting and traceability for luxury products in early 2016.  According to their whitepaper, VeChain’s vision and goal innovating in blockchain is to lower the barrier of entry for businesses and enabling established business with blockchain technology to create value and solve real world economic problems.

* VeChain's target audience are businesses that require [identification, verification, and confirmation](https://www.securities.io/investing-in-vechain-vet-everything-you-need-to-know/) within the supply chain process.

* This is a unique niche when looking at the market size of the users and stakeholders. According to [Deloitte’s 2019 Global Blockchain Survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/2019-global-blockchain-survey/DI_2019-global-blockchain-survey.pdf), a poll of 1,386 senior executives from established business globally revealed 53% (10% YOY growth) indicated blockchain technology had become a critical priority for their organizations in 2019, backed by strong investment trends in new blockchain initiatives.  83% (10% YOY growth) indicated they saw compelling use cases for blockchain.

* Despite these trends, the top reason for the lack of adoption was indicated as a lack of in-house capabilities and uncertain ROI (“Return on Investment”) among the top 5 barriers considered by enterprises to increasing adoption and scale in blockchain technology.

* One of the largest advantages that VeChain has over it's competitors is approval by the [Chinese Cyber Space Management Bureau](https://www.investinblockchain.com/chinese-regulator-approved-197-blockchain-companies-only-one-crypto-project-you-can-invest-in/). Blockchains must be approved by the bureau for the commercial use of blockchains by individuals or institutions. Adding to this fact that China [is the world’s largest manufacturing hub, producing 36% of the world’s electronics](https://www.semiconductors.org/taking-stock-of-chinas-semiconductor-industry/), including smartphones, computers, cloud servers, and telecom infrastructure.  China currently is the largest node in the global electronics supply chain. In addition, with nearly one-fifth of the world’s population, China is the second-largest final consumption market, after the U.S. for electronic devices embedded with semiconductors.

* [Public blockchains do not curry the favor of the Chinese government](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/28/75234/chinas-leaders-have-embraced-blockchains-erm-minus-the-decentralized-bit/). However, if the blockchain is centralized, where stakeholders, and often those [enterprise users](https://vechainofficial.medium.com/https-medium-com-vechainofficial-authority-masternodes-4c1233c6f18e) that want to monitor shipments. Hence, VeChain’s proof of authority consensus, coupled with partnering with business clients, makes the blockchain easily auditable, [posing less concern and garnering approval from the Chinese government](https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/geopolitical-effects-on-vechain-2570538). Enterprise clients such as [Walmart China, utilziing VeChain in food traceability](https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-china-subsidiary-teams-up-with-vechain-to-trace-food-products), and sovereign nations like [San Marino](https://cointelegraph.com/news/san-marino-approves-vechain-enft-vaccination-certificate-that-s-verifiable-worldwide) utilizing VeChain for a Covid Passport, necessitates trust-building through company transparency and examination. As a result, VeChain is becoming a favored blockchain solution in China.

A local media report indicates that VeChain had been included in [China’s 5 year national development plan](https://vechainofficial.medium.com/vechains-national-level-partnership-b3bc792cb1f1), as the country looks to build out an digital e-yuan and their local Blockchain Service Network.

* The supply chain industry is often hand in hand with quality assurance providers currently led by giants such as DNV GL, SGS, Intertek, NQA as well as consulting firms such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Deloitte.  These organizations sell their reputation and harbor an embodiment of trust in business.

* Another advantage that VeChain has to its competitors is [partnership with is DNV GL the world’s largest and oldest assurance provider](https://supplychaindigital.com/technology-4/audit-giant-dnv-gl-partners-vechain-push-blockchain-technology). DNV GL's business model is to set the standards in certain industries like energy or medical. Governments and companies seek advice from DNV GL.  These kinds of partnerships, have harbored trusts that have landed VeChain contracts, such as natural gas projects, [aiming to provide a quality assurance process for the different types of natural gas in China](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/vechain-blockchain-china-liquefied-natural-gas/), are likely because of the sway of DNV GL.

* By partnering up with key providers who are leaders of quality assurance industries such as DNV-GL, PwC and others, companies are able to ensure the quality of theirs and their supplier’s internal processes, providing assurance for the quality of data entering the blockchain in the first instance. By guaranteeing the quality of data, enterprise clients can enable numerous new kinds of collaborative business models. This is a win-win situation for both VeChain and assurance giants as the value of trust is now transparent and enhanced for all stakeholders.

* VeChain employs a variety of technologies that interact with the blockchain.  VeChain utilizes a variety of technologies to accomplish its goal to streamline the supply chain sector. For example, [VeChain uses various types of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags](https://www.securities.io/investing-in-vechain-vet-everything-you-need-to-know/) and sensors to monitor critical data during shipment. This information is broadcast in real-time across the blockchain.  In conjunction with this, Vechain makes their own ID sensors but they can integrate with other IoT sensors like a Quick Response (QR) codes, and Near Field Communication (NFC) codes.

* Another technology employed by VeChain is a proprietary service called ToolChain.  [VeChain ToolChain is a self-developed comprehensive blockchain application platform](https://creamandpartners.com/vechain-toolchain-how-vechain-became-the-aws-of-public-blockchain/) backed by the VeChainThor blockchain. 
* When enterprises sign up to use VeChain ToolChain, the software service includes readily customisable mobile applications, IoT chips and sensors, access to the VeChainThor blockchain, support from the VeChain team and access to VeChain’s unique native fee delegation functionality. The platform’s real-world readiness is significantly enhanced by ‘ToolChain Credits’ (TCC), a non-crypto credit that can be purchased by a business and spent writing data. 

## Landscape:

* The company targets industries shown in the domains below:
![VeChainMarket](VeChain_Market.JPG)

* Reviewing each industry under VeChain's model is guided by the overarching principal of accountability and tracability, as trends over the last 5 to 10 years within each industries supply chain has been to reduce cost, and improve transparency along the supply chain.
* The counterfeit market is a [$30 billion industry](https://cryptoticker.io/en/vechain-the-future-of-supply-chain-management-is-here/).  This trend is only going to continue as consumer markets, [according to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR)](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/24/2252779/0/en/Anti-Counterfeit-Packaging-Market-to-reach-USD-237-81-billion-by-2027-Report-by-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html), Anti-Counterfeit Packaging Market Research Report, "the market is projected to reach USD 237.81 billion by 2027 from an estimated USD 110.2 billion in 2020, at a CAGR of 12.93% from 2021 to 2027."
* Examples of government bodies awareness is embodied within the food safety traceability industry, the FDA within the United States in 2020 began an initiative to improve traceability along the food supply chain, where [according to FDA](https://www.food-safety.com/articles/7268-fdas-focus-on-food-traceability), “The New Era of Smarter Food Safety represents a new approach to food safety, leveraging technology and other tools to create a safer and more digital, traceable food system.” Correspondingly, the New Era is built on four core elements to support FDA’s ultimate goal of reducing foodborne illness. One of those elements is Tech-Enabled Traceability.
* Another industry is within the manufacture and imports of natural gas.  One of the largest problems facing this industry is [being able to produce more energy at lower cost with less emissions](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/challenges-and-trends-for-the-oil-and-gas-industry/). Trends within this industry have yielded a global community push for goverments to adopt a carbond credit / carbon tax initiatives. These initiatves have solutions within blockchain technology that offer businesses the capability to offset carbon output and earn certified government credits.

* Vechain is not the only company attempting to create adoption of new technologies within the supply chain industry, whether through the usage of proprietary devices companies implement themselves or a mixture of devices synced with the blockchain.  Some of their top competitors are listed below:

  * [Everledger](https://everledger.io/our-platform/) supports demand generation, sustainability and compliance for global supply chains.
  * [Moeco's](https://moeco.io/#moeco_platform) decentralized platform is a web-interface that allows clients to manage their trackers data and receive actionable insights and alerts from it.
  * [Ripe](https://www.ripe.io/) platform empowers our food supply chain partners to offer quality food and transparency. our system tracks the journey of food, from seed to sale offering consumer satisfaction and faith that they are receiving the freshest, best product possible.
  * [OpenSC](https://opensc.org/vision.html) uses data collected directly from customer’s supply chains and continuously analyses it to Verify claims such as, deforestation-free palm oil, Confirming the right payments to coffee farmers, Only fishing where it is sustainable to do so.
  * [OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/case-studies/food-traceability), who utilizes customers scanning a QR code, consumers can meet farmers and learn about animal-friendly conditions on their farms.

## Results

* The VeChainThor blockchain has seem results that have garnered multiple of well known company partnerships. For example:
  * The blockchain found usage in verifiably tracing the results of an ecological project.  [ReSea Project](https://cryptoslate.com/vechain-vet-verifies-results-of-a-305-metric-tonne-plastic-clean-up-in-the-ocean/), a Danish company with a community-driven solution to remove plastic from oceans and rivers in Indonesia, cleared 305 metric tonnes of plastic waste from the ocean, with verified results using VeChain.
  
  * With each new partnership, they are enabling enterprises to adopt new technologies. [Sam’s Club, a China-based subsidiary of Walmart](https://www.bluegatebs.com/2021/01/14/walmart-china-subsidiary-teams-up-with-vechain-to-trace-food-products/), partnered with VeChain for food traceability solutions. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) assisted in the Sam’s Club Blockchain Traceability Platform project, which goals intended to ensure food safety and afford greater transparency to consumers in China. Since 2019 PwC China and Walmart China have been in close partnership developing a traceability platform on the VeChain blockchain called the Walmart China Blockchain Traceability Platform.
  
  * San Marino, a small republic situated on the slopes of Mount Titano, on the Adriatic side of central Italy between the Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions and surrounded on all sides by the republic of Italy.  Have also taken to adopting blockchain.  For reference where San Marino is, see below:
![SanMarino](SanMarino.PNG)
  
  * San Marino, [working with VeChain](https://www.dnv.com/news/san-marino-republic-adopts-blockchain-to-become-the-first-carbon-neutral-country--154173), began an initative for a "Low Carbon Ecosystem", proposed by DNV GL. The initiatve's goal is to reduce CO2 emissions and encourage environmentally friendly practices such as water saving, waste disposal and management. The practices will be rewarded through a utility token, the San Marino Innovation Token issued by San Marino Innovation, which is used to access services offered within the Republic. The introduction of the low carbon ecosystem represents a first global example of incentivization through the use of blockchain technology and a utility token.  THe project is unique in that it engages citizens, rewarding 'sustainable' behavior, while also meeting San Marino's CO2 emissions reduction, water saving, waste disposal, and management goals.
  
  * VeChain has also been [adopted by H&M](https://vechain101.com/vechains-and-cos/), H&M is the second-largest global clothing retailer with over 5000 stores worldwide. Next to the H&M brand, the company runs five other brands, COS and Arket, are amongst those most recognizable.  Cos, a luxury subsidiary of the fast-fashion brand H&M, is using DNV GL’s MyStory tags running on VeChain to collect supply chain data for some of its product lines and share that information with its customers. Arket, another brand of H&M has been using VeChain to track sustainable wool since 2018.  In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with the CEO, Sunny Lu, he noted over 4,000 items had been tracked using MyStory platform.

* VeChain, a Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) company, has several metrics that are often the measure of success.
  
  * Adoption - Like many blockchains, adoption is key for longevity. If no one uses the blockchain, if no developers build or create decentralized apps (dapps) withn the ecosystem, the project and blockchain may become defunct.  VeChain excels at this being named [one of the fastest growing start-ups](https://newslogical.com/vechain-named-one-of-the-fastest-growing-start-ups/), by SMEs rating agency, Early Metrics, as the rating agency noted VeChain has succeeded in advancing the development of its proprietary technology even with the COVID-19 pandemic.  As well as noted earlier, they have gained partnerships with large corperations and countries that have began building within the VeChain ecosystem.
  
  * Decentralization - This is clearly VeChains largest criticism.  [VeChain differs from other projects](https://www.securities.io/investing-in-vechain-vet-everything-you-need-to-know/) in that the developers behind this project had no desire to create a fully decentralized platform. Instead, their goal was to integrate the best features from both the DeFi (decentralized finance) and CeFi (centralized finance) sectors to integrate into supply chain managment.  VeChain acknowledges ultimately the VeChain blockchain was built for supply chain management, meaning there is essentially no reason a retail user needs the coin.
  
  * Transaction cost - VeChain [adopted a two-token model](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/vechain-abridged): the VET token and the VTHO token. As explained in the post by cryptoeq.io, "The two-token economic model of the VeChainThor blockchain is designed to detach the cost of transacting on the blockchain with market volatility.  Simply put, this keeps the cost stable associated with transacting or executing smart contracts on the VeChainThor blockchain. VET is the primary token of VeChain and it has several uses. VET’s main use cases are to govern the network, store and transfer value. VTHO is the secondary transactional token or ‘gas’ token of VeChain. When executing transactions, a small amount of VTHO is required for the transactional cost. Companies and developers utilizing the blockchain must use VTHO to add data to the blockchain and create smart contracts. This is similar to Ethereum, only Ethereum is a single token blockchain and just uses ether for its gas payments. However, in Ethereum’s case, as token prices and network adoption increase, transaction fees also increase. Network congestion causes fees to rise and makes interacting with the blockchain impractical for some use cases. VeChain’s dual-token model aims to eliminate that issue and provide stable prices for their enterprise business environment. If fees become too high, the VeChain Foundation and Steering Committee are able to adjust the minimum amount of VTHO needed for a transaction (currently 21) and/or increase the issuance of VTHO per VET. This allows the market for VTHO to stay predictable for the companies using the chain. However, this is inarguably a centralized, top-down system where a small group can make dramatic changes to the protocol. All VET holders, enterprise and retail, are trusting the VeChain Foundation with their funds."

* Despite VeChain's lack of decentralization. VeChain has garnered trust, partnering with companies in the "Big 4" accounting firms PWC, and Deloitte, as well as [large corperations](https://usethebitcoin.com/list-of-vechain-partnerships/) alike such as Walmart, Louis Vitton, and H&M and most recently, a US custom sneaker and streetware company [Deadstock](http://news-en.vechain.com/usa-custom-sneaker-and-hi-tech-streetwear-marketplace-deadstock-adopts-vechains-blockchainiot-solutions-for-authenticity/).


## Recommendations

* VeChain is working within many different industries, Vechain, unlike some competitors named earlier, may find it more difficult to deliver results for every niche.  My recommendation for VeChain is to begin carving out unique assets within a smaller niche to gain market dominance.  Another recommendation would be to change the model of the authorized nodes where essentially stakeholders monitoring data are the users and beneficiaries of owning a node.  It may be more beneficial to offer to the public the same benefit.  This may offer a more decentralized offering lending to the security of the network. In current state, if one masternode had a bad attacker, they could manipulate a block, albeit this should be caught by other nodes, this may not be the case with a limited number of master nodes. This does not mean that VeChain should eliminate their Know-Your-Clients (KYC), in fact, it may mean enhancing their KYC and upgrading to account for citizen owned master nodes.
